    *********************************************

SquirrelMail Select Language plugin allows to choose interface language
in login form.

This plugin release fixes issues with custom_charset plugin and removes 
$available_languages support. $available_languages configuration option
was available only in 1.5.1cvs. Features provided by this configuration
options are implemented in limit_languages plugin. They are not used
in 1.5.1+ due to implemented dynamic translation loading functions.
