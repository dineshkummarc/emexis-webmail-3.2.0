Installing Plugin
=================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the select_language
plugin.

    $ cd /var/www/squirrelmail/plugins
    $ tar -xzvf /home/archives/select_language-1.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

    $ cd ../config/
    $ ./conf.pl

Some plugin settings can be adjusted by creating 
config/select_language_config.php or 
plugins/select_language/config.php configuration file.
See plugins/select_language/config_default.php.

If both configuration files are present, plugin uses the one in 
config/ directory. If configuration files are not present, plugin
uses default configuration. 

Plugin translations use select_language domain. select_language.po 
and select_language.mo files should be stored in same directory 
that stores squirrelmail.po and squirrelmail.mo files. Translations 
are maintained by SquirrelMail Internationalization Team and are 
distributed in SquirrelMail locale packages.


login_form hook patch
=====================
Older SquirrelMail versions uses do_hook call in login_form hook.
Plugins add code to login form after login button. If you want 
to see language selection box before login button, you must patch
your SquirrelMail install and set select_language_patched option
in plugin's configuration file.

You can patch SquirrelMail with 'patch -p 0 < login.php.diff' command.

  cd /path/to/squirrelmail
  cd src
  patch -p 0 < ../plugins/select_language/login.php.diff

See SquirrelMail tracker #1245070 for more details about issue.

WARNING: Patch can break formating in login_auto, multilogin and
show_ssl_link plugins.
