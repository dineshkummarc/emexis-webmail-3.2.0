Addressbook Import-Export ChangeLog
$Id: CHANGELOG,v 1.30 2007/06/09 08:38:42 tokul Exp $
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Todo for 1.2:
 * Own implementation of fgetcsv in order to solve multiple delimiter
   issues. PHP allows to use only one character for delimiter.
 * Add options that force data import by adding custom data 
   to empty required fields.

1.1
 * Fixed uploaded file locking issues on Windows OSes.
 * Handle attachment directory configuration without trailing delimiter.
 * Added UPLOAD_ERR_EXTENSION handling.

1.0:
 * Fixed notice about missing label field in some csv imports. 

1.0rc1:
 * Address book object is checked for errors after addressbook_init().
 * Address book export uses text/comma-separated-values MIME type instead
   of application/CSV.
 * Fixed detection of LDIF import.
 * Removed empty columns from the end of imported CSV array.

1.0pre1:
 * Fixed translation of address book backend name.
 * Added input character set and delimiter selection options. Minimal 
   SquirrelMail version increased to 1.4.4. Older versions don't 
   support required character set conversion functions.
 * Reduced minimal data requirements to two fields.
 * Check if file uploads are enabled before creating address book import 
   form.
 * Added php 4.2+ upload error processing.
 * Uploaded address books are moved to attachment directory before 
   processing. Fixes issues with open_basedir limits.
 * Added bind_textdomain_codeset support.
 * Address book backend selection is limited to backends that allow 
   writing (for import) and listing (for export).
 * Added backend selection to export form.
 * Export form sends file headers with standard SquirrelMail 
   SendDownloadHeaders() function.
 * Added string delimiter option to exported data.
 * Started using own functions for error messages.
 * Added SquirrelMail 1.5.2+ init support.
 * Disabled comment sections that were broken in html standards 
   compliance rendering mode.
 * Added header to csv export.
 * Reduced number of writes to session. Session data is accessed with
   standard SquirrelMail sqsession_* and sqGetGlobalVar functions.
 * Added failsafe dgettext() function for setups that don't support it.

0.9:
 * Use sqGetGlobalVar() to check $_POST vars in scripts.

0.9rc1: 
 * Removed import size limit from import form and made it configurable.
   v.0.8 changelog contains incorrect information and size limit is
   still present in v.0.8 import form.
 * Code cleanup.
 * Use 'aie_' prefix in function names.
 * Internationalization fixes. Use abook_import_export gettext domain
   and convert strings to gettext.
 * Added site configuration options. See INSTALL
 * Fixed php errors for csv with small number of fields.
 * Added visible column numbers to imported data in order to identify 
   failed imports.
 * Retrieve user agent string with sqGetGlobalVar from server vars 
   instead of $_ENV.
 * Moved import button to bottom of the page in order to load entire 
   form before displaying it.

0.8:
 * Fixed import to remove 5k import limit.
 * Added ability to select different addressbook backends.

0.7:
 * Major changes to the import function. Can now import from Outlook as
   long as it has a "First Name", "Last Name", and "E-mail Address"
   field specified somewhere in the first row. Also changed
   reordering functionality after the file has been uploaded and 
   before the changes to the address book

0.6:
 * Fixes a bug with the export feature.  The username variable was not
   being exported to that procedure and the download stream was not
   opening correctly.
