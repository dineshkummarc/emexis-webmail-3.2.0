Installing Plugin
=================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 0.9 version of the abook_import_export
plugin.

    $ cd /var/www/squirrelmail/plugins
    $ tar -xzvf /home/archives/abook_import_export-0.9-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

    $ cd ../config/
    $ ./conf.pl

3) Log into SquirrelMail, go to 'Addresses' and find forms for 
importing and exporting your address book at the bottom of the page.

Plugin requires SquirrelMail 1.4.4 or later. 1.5.0 version is not 
supported. Address book import works only when file_uploads setting 
is enabled in PHP and SquirrelMail attachment directory is writable.
Use of PHP with gettext support is recommended, if plugin is used 
in SquirrelMail 1.4.x.

Some plugin settings can be adjusted by creating 
config/abook_import_export_config.php or 
plugins/abook_import_export/config.php configuration file.
See plugins/abook_import_export/config_default.php.

If both configuration files are present, plugin uses the one in 
config/ directory. If configuration files are not present, plugin
uses default configuration. 

Plugin translations use abook_import_export domain. 
abook_import_export.po and abook_import_export.mo files should be 
stored in same directory that stores squirrelmail.po and 
squirrelmail.mo files. Translations are maintained by SquirrelMail 
Internationalization Team and are distributed in SquirrelMail locale 
packages.
