Configuration changes
---------------------
This plugin version adds two configuration variables. 
$aie_input_charsets array stores character sets that can be 
used for address book conversions. Default variable value matches
standard SquirrelMail 1.4.4 decoding character sets. If other
character sets are added to this array, they must be supported by
SquirrelMail decoding functions (see functions/decode directory).
$aie_hide_upload_error boolean variable allows to disable error 
message, which is displayed when file uploads are disabled in PHP
configuration.

Plugin is backwards compatible with v.0.9 site configuration files.

Requirements
------------
This plugin version increased minimal SquirrelMail version 
requirements. Plugin requires SquirrelMail 1.4.4 or later. 
SquirrelMail 1.5.0 version is not supported. Older SquirrelMail 
versions don't provide functions required for new plugin features.
If you use older SquirrelMail version - upgrade it or use 
abook_import_export v.0.9 plugin.

Use of PHP 4.3.0 or later is recommended. If PHP does not have 
gettext extension support - use of SquirrelMail 1.5.1 or later is
recommended.

Other changes
-------------
This plugin version is updated to work with modified SquirrelMail 
1.5.2 init structure. Other plugin changes are listed in CHANGELOG
file.

Issues
------
Text delimiter options are not available in older PHP versions. 
Upload errors are not verbose in PHP 4.1.x. Plugin translations 
might have issues in PHP 4.1.x with gettext extension and in 
all SquirrelMail 1.4.x installations, when PHP gettext extension 
is not available.

These issues are related to limited options provided by older 
PHP and SquirrelMail versions. They can't be fixed in plugin 
without some complex hacks.
