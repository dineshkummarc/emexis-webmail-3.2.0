Error messages
==============
Some plugin error messages direct end user to system administrator.
If end user selects different interface language, error messages 
can be translated to selected language.

Here goes explanation of error messages and ways to solve them.

* "Imported CSV file is too big."
* "The uploaded file exceeds the MAX_FILE_SIZE directive that was 
  specified in the HTML."

  Plugin defaults to 5 KB upload limit. It can be increased in site
  configuration file, $aie_csv_maxsize variable. See INSTALL 
  documentation and plugins/abook_import_export/config_default.php
  file.

  5KB limit is historical. Older plugin versions used this value. 
  Imported address books usually exceed it. Variable makes sure 
  that you read plugin install documentation. Don't set it to very 
  high value. If limit is too high, users might hit session data 
  storage or PHP memory limits.

  Please note that plugin uses html MAX_FILE_SIZE attribute in 
  upload form, but it does not trust submitted value when 
  uploaded data is processed. Uploaded data size is always compared 
  with $aie_csv_maxsize configuration variable. 'MAX_FILE_SIZE' 
  error is standard PHP error message. It can be displayed only
  when uploaded address book size is very close to address book 
  upload limits set by $aie_csv_maxsize.

* "Can't move uploaded file to attachment directory."

  Plugin stores processed data in SquirrelMail attachment directory.
  SquirrelMail can look functional, when attachment directory is not
  writable, but all uploads will fail. Please check your config. 
  Directory specified in $attachment_dir settings must be writable.
  If relative paths are used, they must use SM_PATH constant.

* "Address book uploads are disabled."

  You have file uploads disabled in PHP configuration. End users 
  can't import address books. Enable file uploads or set 
  $aie_hide_upload_error configuration variable to true. If you have 
  set this PHP configuration variable with php_value or php_admin_value,
  fix your configuration. file_uploads variable is boolean and should 
  be set with php_flag or php_admin_flag.

* "Unable to access uploaded data."

  Plugin should save uploaded data in session during first import stage
  and retrieve it in second stage. Error message is displayed when data
  retrieval fails in second stage. This is a simple safety check. It is 
  unlikely to happen. If you see it, error might be caused by some 
  limitations in your session handler. Maybe by session data size 
  limits.

* "The uploaded file exceeds the upload_max_filesize directive in php.ini."
* "The uploaded file was only partially uploaded."
* "No file was uploaded."
* "Missing a temporary folder."
* "Failed to write file to disk."

  Standand PHP upload error messages. Something is wrong with file 
  uploads. See http://www.php.net/features.file-upload

* "Please select a file for uploading."

  End user forgot to select file that must be uploaded or selected data is
  unreadable.

* "Unknown upload error."

  PHP upload error handler returned unknown error code. Maybe your 
  PHP version introduced some new error code variable and plugin 
  can't handle it. Please inform plugin developers about this error
  and provide information about used PHP version.
