           "Just a small patch for the text displayed next to the

           but on 'name'."

           Essentially cleaned up a few files junk files left
           around.  Changed the agroup_database.php file so that
           based on the $addrbook_dsn variable set by the config.php 
           (ie configure) was set to "" we were then using flat file
           format.  If it was set to anything else then we're back
           to using databases...

           Noticed there wasn't a close button available after you
           clicked on the groups button and pulled up the groups window
           so I simply added it.
