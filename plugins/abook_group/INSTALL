UPGRADING:
----------
This applies to upgrading to version >= 0.35.

Some languages were not displaying the members of existing groups.
To fix this problem I changed the way the "type" field stored it's 
information (i.e., "Personal address book").  The "type" field now 
stores this information in English, but is still translated for the
end user.  This also gives you the ability to list groups created
in other languages.

To upgrade install the newest version of the plugin and then modify
your database with something similar to:

UPDATE addressgroups
SET type='Personal address book'
WHERE owner='mike';
 
'mike' should be replaced with the user whos groups need to be changed.          

INSTALL:
--------
Backend for personal addressbook stored in a database,
accessed using the DB-classes in PEAR. Follow the instructions
in doc/db-backend.txt to get that setup. 

When you've got that done copy the tar.gz to plugins/ directory 
and:

  tar zxvf abook_group.tar.gz 

USING FLAT FILE SUPPORT:
------------------------
If a database hasn't been selected using the configure script then this
plugin will attempt to use a flat file format.  If you selected database
support continue reading:

USING A DATABASE:
-----------------
You'll need to create an addressgroups table in your database. 
The table used should have the following columns:

    Columns   | Type | Modifier
--------------+------+----------
 owner        | text |
 nickname     | text |
 addressgroup | text |
 type         | text |

The pair (owner,nickname, addressgroup, type) should be unique.

The (owner,nickname) pair is the unique reference to the addressbook
of the owner.

Type comes in when you have two different types of address books:
abook_database.php
abook_global_database.php

To create the table you could use something like this:

create table addressgroups(
 owner varchar(128),
 nickname varchar(128),
 addressgroup varchar(128),
 type varchar(128)
 );

The lengths and datatype of the fields are suggested. Modify them to suit
your needs, especially if you use a different database. 

TRANSLATIONS:
-------------
Translations are stored in plugins/abook_group/locale directory. String 
template is stored in plugins/abook_group/po/.
